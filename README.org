* Overview
- Path Tracing
- This whole code base was part of CS538 at SUNY Polytechnic taught by Dr Michael J. Reale for Spring 2024
- Student: Zachary Harvey
- The PotatoRenderEngine has been modified to run a path tracer.
* Running the Project
- The built binary will come out in the build directory under the name of PotatoRenderEngine
- No command line arguments

* Core Files
- PotatoRayEngine.{hpp,cpp}
  + Holds the basic ray tracer and brings all the pieces together.
- Ray.hpp
  + Just holds the origin and direction for a ray
- camera.{hpp,cpp}
  + The camera class largely holds all the information about the world and ends up being where most of the actual work is done
- interval.hpp
  + This just holds basically the min and max t values
- objects.{hpp,cpp}
  + This is the geometry that represents all the drawable and ray hittable objects.

* Dependencies
- CMake GLFW GLEW GLM Assimp Vulkan SDK and doctest
